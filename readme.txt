**NOTE**
The plugin does not currently support the WooCommerce Blocks checkout. To use this plugin you need to have a normal checkout page that has the [woocommerce_checkout] shortcode. If you’re setting up a brand new website with a fresh version of WooCommerce installed on it, then by default, WooCommerce will create your checkout page as a Blocks checkout page.

For this plugin to work, you need to delete all contents of that blocks page and add the shortcode: [woocommerce_checkout] inside it. You can see this link for reverting to classic checkout: WooCommerce article

Once thats done you’ll have the normal WooCommerce checkout page and the plugin options will show. Still need help? Submit a support request here.
